# java-data-structures

A collection of **data structure implementations in Java**.  
I upload one new implementation every week to practice core concepts and build a solid reference for learners.

---

##  Goal
- Strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Learn and implement data structures from scratch.
- Share clean and well-documented Java code.

---

##  Repository Structure
Each data structure has its own folder with:
- Java implementation file(s).
- Example usage in a `main()` method.
- A short README

---

##  Progress
- [x] List
- [X] Linked List
- [x] Doubly Linked List
- [X] Stack
- [X] Queue
- [x] Binary Tree
- [X] Heap
- [ ] More coming soon...
