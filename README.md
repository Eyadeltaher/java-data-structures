# java-data-structures

📘 A collection of **data structure implementations in Java**.  
I upload one new implementation every week to practice core concepts and build a solid reference for learners.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each data structure has its own folder with:
- Java implementation file(s).
- Example usage in a `main()` method.
- A short README
